## How to add GIF demos

1. Create an optimized GIF (recommendation: 600–900px width, < 3–4 MB). Tools: FFmpeg, Ezgif.com or ScreenToGif.
2. Put the file in `assets/gifs/` and name it exactly as referenced above (for example `device-manager-demo.gif`).
3. Commit the new GIF to the repo. The README will render it automatically on GitHub.

If you prefer using hosted images (Cloudflare, Imgur, or GitHub Releases), update the image URLs in the project cards.

## Badges & metrics (optional)

You can add dynamic profile badges (repo languages, GitHub stats, top languages, or readme-stats) using services like shields.io or readme-stats. Example badges are already at the top — swap the repo name in the URL if you move this README to a different repo.
